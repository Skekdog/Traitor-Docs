Once you have the general structure of your asset down, you may want to playtest and see it in action.

To do this, you should use the Publish function of the SDK. This requires an API key. To get the API key, message `skekdog` on Discord. If you are working in a team, you may request a team key for all of your team members.

Once you have received your API key, keep it private! The API key acts as your password to publishing, and anyone who has it can load your published assets, or overwrite your work!

Once published, you can now load the asset in Traitor! To do this, create a free private server in the [Labs](https://www.roblox.com/games/118757439615813/) game, and join it. Once you have joined, you will have access to a console, where you can run commands to host your server.

To load a map, use the command: `map AssetId`<br/>
To load a gamemode, use: `gamemode AssetId`<br/>
To load a boss, use: `boss AssetId`<br/>
To see other commands, use the command: `help`

Now if everything has gone well, you will be able to play your map or gamemode!
